    <p class="title">To My Dearest,</p>

    <p>
      i know we've been through a lot, and i respect what we had and where we are now.
      i'm not to ask something you're not ready to give. i just want you to know how
      i genuinely feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      i remember what i promised you before— not as something you owe me,
      but as something i chose; that i would keep choosing you when things
      aren't easy, even when there's no certainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      talking to you again reminded me of the parts i appreciated— not just as
      my girlfriend before, but as a person. i still care about you,
      and that hasn't changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      i'm not saying this to rush you. i just want you to know that my intention
      stayed the same. i'm here because i want to be, not because of the past,
      but because of how i wholeheartedly feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      i hope you know that i'm always here.
      <br>
      no pressure, no expectations, just honesty.
    </p>

    <p class="signature">
      your love,<br>
      ren.
